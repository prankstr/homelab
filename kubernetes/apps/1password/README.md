# [1Password Connect & 1Password Operator](https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator)

1Password Operator is a Kubernetes operator for managing Kubernetes secrets in 1Password. I store all sensitive data in 1Password and this operator allows me to sync those secrets to my Kubernetes clusters.

1Password Connect is the interface that sits between the operator and 1Password. Connect can also be used with the [External Secrets Operator](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/) which is something I might explore later on. That would allow for a smoother transition if I ever want to switch from 1Password to something else.

Deployed from the official [helm chart](https://github.com/1Password/connect-helm-charts)

## Installation

This either has to be installed manually with helm first or by creating a couple of secrets beforehand. I chose the latter.

1. Create and download 1Password credentials and a connect token:

   - Sign in to your account on 1Password.com.
   - Select Developer Tools from the sidebar.
   - Under Infrastructure Secrets Management, select Other.
   - Select Create a Connect Server.
   - Follow the onscreen instructions to create a 1Password-credentials.json file and connect token.

2. Create namespace and secret Kubernetes secrets:

   ```bash
   kubectl create ns 1password
   kubectl create secret generic op-credentials -n 1password --from-file=1password-credentials.json
   kubectl create secret generic onepassword-token -n 1password --from-literal=<token>
   ```

3. Operator can now be installed via Argo with the provided manifests. To use other secret names you have to modify the values, these are defaults
