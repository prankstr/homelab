# [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/)

Ingress controller for kubernetes, I use it to expose services in the cluster to the outside world. It's Essetially a reverse proxy that is configured with ingress objects.

Deployed from the official helm chart.

Will be replaced by kgateway once [ListenerSets](https://cert-manager.io/announcements/2025/11/26/ingress-nginx-eol-and-gateway-api/) are available.
